## Review Guidelines

### How to Review a Problem

1. **Don't look at your solution first** (5 min)
   - Try to recall the approach
   - What pattern was it?
   - What was the key insight?

2. **Attempt to solve again** (10-15 min)
   - Can you solve it without looking?
   - Is it easier than the first time?

3. **Compare with your original solution** (5 min)
   - Did you use the same approach?
   - Is your new solution better?
   - What did you forget?

4. **Document** (2 min)
   - Mark as reviewed
   - Note what you remembered/forgot
   - Schedule next review if needed

### Review Success Criteria

✅ **Successful Review:**
- Remembered the pattern immediately
- Solved without looking at solution
- Understood why it works

⚠️ **Needs More Practice:**
- Forgot the pattern
- Needed hints
- Couldn't explain complexity

❌ **Failed Review:**
- Couldn't solve at all
- Forgot everything
- **Action:** Solve again and review in 2 days

## Tips for Effective Reviews

1. **Don't Skip Reviews**
   - They're as important as solving new problems
   - This is how you build long-term memory

2. **Be Honest**
   - If you forgot, mark it as "needs practice"
   - Don't just look at the solution and say "oh yeah"

3. **Focus on Understanding**
   - Why does this solution work?
   - When would I use this pattern?
   - What are the edge cases?

4. **Track Patterns**
   - Which patterns do you always remember?
   - Which patterns do you always forget?
   - Adjust your study plan accordingly

5. **Use Active Recall**
   - Try to solve before looking
   - Explain out loud
   - Teach someone (or me!)
