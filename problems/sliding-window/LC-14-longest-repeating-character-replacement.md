## 📝 Problem Statement

Problem URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement
Problem Description:
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.
Example 1:
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists of only uppercase English letters.
0 <= k <= s.length
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Sliding Window
