## 📝 Problem Statement

Problem URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence
Problem Description:
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
Constraints:
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Array & Hashing
