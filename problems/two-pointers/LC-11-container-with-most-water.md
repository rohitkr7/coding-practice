## 📝 Problem Statement

Problem URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water
Problem Description:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.
Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Constraints:
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Two Pointers
