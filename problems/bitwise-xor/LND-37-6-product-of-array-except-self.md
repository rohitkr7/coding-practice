## 📝 Problem Statement

Problem URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self
Problem Description:
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm running in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Array & Hashing
