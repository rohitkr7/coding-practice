## 🚀 How to Start

### Step 1: Pick a Problem
Browse the `PROBLEM_INDEX.md` file or explore pattern folders directly.

**Recommended starting patterns:**
1. **Sliding Window** - Great for building intuition (6 problems)
2. **Two Pointers** - Most common pattern (25 problems)
3. **Binary Search** - Essential skill (4 problems)

### Step 2: Open a Problem File
Each problem file contains:
- ✅ Jira ticket link
- ✅ LeetCode problem link
- ✅ Pattern identification
- ✅ Structured template for your solution
- ✅ Sections for notes, complexity analysis, and learnings

**Example:** `problems/sliding-window/LND-126-13-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.md`

### Step 3: Tell Me Which Problem You Want to Work On
```
"Let's work on LND-126 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"
```

### Step 4: I'll Guide You!
I'll help you by:
- 🤔 Asking clarifying questions
- 💡 Suggesting the right approach
- 🎯 Providing hints when you're stuck
- ✅ Validating your solution approach
- 📊 Discussing time/space complexity

**Remember:** I won't give you the complete solution! You'll learn by thinking through it yourself.

## 💡 Example: Let's Solve a Problem Together

### You Say:
> "Let's work on the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters problem"

### I'll Respond:
> "Great choice! This is a classic **Sliding Window** problem. Before we dive in, let's understand it:
> 
> 1. What are we trying to find?
> 2. What makes a substring 'valid' in this problem?
> 3. Can you think of how a 'window' might help us here?
> 
> Take a moment to think about these questions, then share your initial thoughts!"

### You Think & Respond:
> "We need to find the longest substring with unique characters. A window could track the current substring, and we slide it when we find a duplicate?"

### I'll Guide:
> "Excellent thinking! You've identified the key insight. Now:
> 
> 1. What data structure would help you track if a character is already in your window?
> 2. What happens when you encounter a duplicate character?
> 
> Try to work through these questions and sketch out an algorithm!"

## 🎯 Study Strategies

### 1. Start with Easy Patterns
- **Sliding Window** (6 problems)
- **Two Pointers** (25 problems)
- **Fast & Slow Pointers** (1 problem)

### 2. Build Pattern Recognition
After solving 2-3 problems in a pattern:
- Review what they have in common
- Identify the "signature" of that pattern
- Note when to use vs. when NOT to use

### 3. Practice Consistently
- **Daily Goal:** 1-2 problems
- **Weekly Goal:** 5-7 problems
- **Monthly Goal:** 20-25 problems

### 4. Document Everything
Use the problem template to record:
- Your thought process
- Mistakes you made
- Key learnings
- Similar problems

### 5. Weekly Reviews
Every Sunday, review:
- Problems solved this week
- Patterns you're strong/weak in
- Concepts that need more practice
