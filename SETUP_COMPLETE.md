## 💡 How I'll Help You Learn

### My Role as Your Study Assistant

**I WILL:**
1. **Guide with Questions** - Help you think through problems
2. **Suggest Patterns** - Point you to the right approach
3. **Provide Hints** - Give clues without spoiling the solution
4. **Validate Thinking** - Confirm if you're on the right track
5. **Discuss Complexity** - Help analyze time/space complexity
6. **Share Examples** - Use similar problems to illustrate concepts

**I WON'T:**
1. ❌ Give you complete solutions
2. ❌ Write the code for you
3. ❌ Skip the learning process
4. ❌ Solve problems without your involvement

### Example Interaction

**You:** "I need to find the longest substring with K distinct characters"

**Me:** "Great problem! Let's think about this:
1. What pattern might work for substring problems?
2. How can we track distinct characters efficiently?
3. What happens when we exceed K distinct characters?

This looks like a **Sliding Window** problem. Can you think why?"

**You:** "Because we're looking at contiguous characters?"

**Me:** "Exactly! Now, what data structure would help you track distinct characters?"

## 🎓 The 16 Patterns You'll Master

| # | Pattern | When to Use |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Sliding Window | Contiguous subarrays/substrings |
| 2 | Two Pointers | Sorted arrays, finding pairs |
| 3 | Fast & Slow Pointers | Cycle detection |
| 4 | Merge Intervals | Overlapping intervals |
| 5 | Cyclic Sort | Numbers in range [1..n] |
| 6 | LinkedList Reversal | Reverse linked list parts |
| 7 | Tree BFS | Level-order traversal |
| 8 | Tree DFS | Path-based tree problems |
| 9 | Two Heaps | Median, top/bottom elements |
| 10 | Subsets | Combinations/permutations |
| 11 | Binary Search | Sorted data with modifications |
| 12 | Bitwise XOR | Finding unique elements |
| 13 | Top K Elements | Top/smallest K items |
| 14 | K-way Merge | Merging sorted lists |
| 15 | 0/1 Knapsack | Optimization with DP |
| 16 | Topological Sort | Dependency ordering |
