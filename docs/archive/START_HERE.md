## 💡 How This Works

### When You Start a Problem

**You Say:**
> "Let's work on LND-29 - Two Sum"

**I'll Guide You:**
1. 🤔 Ask clarifying questions about the problem
2. 💡 Help you identify the pattern
3. 🎯 Provide hints (not solutions!)
4. ✅ Validate your approach
5. 📊 Discuss time/space complexity

**You Learn:**
- By thinking through the problem yourself
- By making mistakes and learning from them
- By understanding WHY solutions work

---

## 📊 Daily Routine (1.5-2 hours)

### Weekday Schedule
```
15 min  | Review yesterday's problem
15 min  | Read and understand new problem
30 min  | Think about approach, discuss with me
45 min  | Implement your solution
15 min  | Test and analyze complexity
15 min  | Document learnings
```

### Weekend Schedule
```
2 hours  | Tackle harder problems
1 hour   | Review week's problems
30 min   | Update notes and reflections
```

---

## 🎯 Success Principles

### 1. **Deep Learning Over Speed**
- ✅ Understand 1 problem deeply
- ❌ Rush through 10 problems superficially

### 2. **Struggle = Learning**
- ✅ Spend 15-20 min thinking before asking
- ❌ Look at solution immediately

### 3. **Spaced Repetition**
- ✅ Review after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month
- ❌ Solve once and forget

### 4. **Active Recall**
- ✅ Try to solve without looking
- ❌ Just read the solution

### 5. **Pattern Recognition**
- ✅ Learn when to use each pattern
- ❌ Memorize solutions

---

## 📝 How to Track Progress

### After Each Problem:
1. Update the problem file with your solution
2. Mark it complete in `notes/weekly-progress.md`
3. Add to review schedule in `notes/review-schedule.md`
4. Document key learnings

### After Each Week:
1. Complete weekend review session
2. Update weekly progress notes
3. Reflect on what you learned
4. Identify areas needing more practice

### After Each Month:
1. Review all problems from 1 month ago
2. Assess pattern mastery
3. Adjust study plan if needed
