# Start Problem Learning Workflow

## Purpose
Automatically analyze a problem file and provide structured learning guidance aligned with Rohit's learning preferences (hints and guidance, not complete solutions).

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Problem File Analysis
- Read the problem markdown file provided by the user
- Extract key metadata:
  - Problem title and number
  - Jira ticket reference
  - LeetCode URL
  - Pattern category
  - Difficulty level
  - Current status
  - Problem description and examples

### 2. Problem Understanding & Clarification
**CRITICAL: Spend significant time here before jumping to solutions**

Break down the problem statement:
- **What are we given?** (Inputs, data types, constraints)
- **What are we asked to find?** (Output, return type, format)
- **What does the problem really mean?** (Rephrase in simpler terms)
- **What are the constraints?** (Size limits, value ranges, special conditions)
- **What assumptions can we make?** (Sorted? Unique? Non-empty?)
- **What assumptions should we NOT make?** (Common misconceptions)

Walk through examples step-by-step:
- **Trace Example 1:** What happens at each step?
- **Trace Example 2:** How does this differ from Example 1?
- **Create a mental model:** What's the relationship between input and output?
- **Identify transformations:** How does input become output?

Ask clarifying questions to deepen understanding:
- What if the input is empty?
- What if there's only one element?
- Can values repeat?
- Are there any special values to watch for?
- What's the expected behavior in edge cases?

### 3. Initial Intuitions & Observations
Before discussing any specific pattern or approach:
- What do you notice about the examples?
- What patterns or relationships do you see in the data?
- What's your gut feeling about how to approach this?
- What simpler problem does this remind you of?
- If you had to explain this to a friend, how would you describe it?

### 4. **PAUSE FOR USER ENGAGEMENT** 🛑
**CRITICAL: Stop here and wait for user response**

After presenting the problem understanding and initial intuition prompts, STOP and ask the user to share their thoughts:
- Ask them to think about how they would approach the problem
- Request they share any patterns they notice
- Ask if they want to see the core concepts or if they want to try thinking more first
- Only proceed to Core Concepts after the user explicitly responds

This creates active learning rather than passive reading.

### 5. Core Concepts Teaching
**ONLY show this section after user has shared their thoughts and wants to proceed**

Explain the fundamental concepts needed:
- What data structures are involved?
- What algorithms might be relevant?
- What mathematical concepts apply?
- What are the prerequisites?

### 6. Pattern Recognition Guidance
Help identify why this pattern applies:
- What clues in the problem statement point to this pattern?
- What are the characteristics of this pattern?
- When should this pattern be used vs. alternatives?
- What are common variations of this pattern?

### 7. Approach Analysis
Walk through different approaches:
- **Brute Force:** What's the obvious solution? What's its complexity?
- **Optimized Approaches:** What improvements can we make? Why?
- **Trade-offs:** Time vs. space complexity considerations
- **Pattern Application:** How does the identified pattern help?

### 8. Key Insights & Hints
Provide the "aha!" moments WITHOUT giving the solution:
- What's the key insight that unlocks this problem?
- What relationship between data elements should we notice?
- What property can we exploit?
- What's the clever trick or observation?

### 9. Implementation Guidance
Guide with questions and hints:
- What data structure should we use? Why?
- What should we track/store as we iterate?
- What are the loop conditions?
- What edge cases need special handling?
- Provide pseudocode structure, not complete code

### 10. Edge Cases Discussion
Help identify corner cases:
- Empty input
- Single element
- Duplicate values
- Negative numbers
- Maximum/minimum constraints
- Special values (zero, null, etc.)

### 11. Complexity Analysis
Teach how to analyze:
- Time complexity: What operations? How many times?
- Space complexity: What extra space? Why needed?
- Best/average/worst case scenarios
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Teaching Principles

### DO:
- ✅ **FIRST:** Thoroughly explain what the problem is asking (spend significant time here)
- ✅ Break down the problem statement into simple, understandable parts
- ✅ Walk through examples step-by-step to build intuition
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions to guide thinking
- ✅ **PAUSE after Initial Intuitions and wait for user to engage**
- ✅ Ask user to share their thinking before showing core concepts
- ✅ Only reveal core concepts after user has attempted their own thinking
- ✅ Provide hints and nudges in the right direction
- ✅ Explain concepts and patterns thoroughly
- ✅ Use visual examples and walkthroughs
- ✅ Encourage independent problem-solving
- ✅ Validate the user's approach and thinking
- ✅ Point out when they're on the right track
- ✅ Suggest what to think about next

### DON'T:
- ❌ Jump directly to solutions or approaches without problem understanding
- ❌ Assume the user understands what the problem is asking
- ❌ **Show core concepts before user has thought about the problem**
- ❌ Skip the engagement pause - always wait for user response
- ❌ Give complete code solutions upfront
- ❌ Solve the problem for the user
- ❌ Provide answers without explanation
- ❌ Skip the learning process
- ❌ Just show the optimal solution
- ❌ Continue past Initial Intuitions without user confirmation

## Output Format

Structure the response as:

```
🎯 **Problem: [Title]**

📋 **Problem Details:**
- Pattern: [Pattern Name]
- Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

## 🛑 YOUR TURN TO THINK

**Stop here! Before I show you the core concepts and solution approaches:**

1. **Take a moment** to think about how you might solve this
2. **Share your thoughts:** What approach would you try? What data structures come to mind?
